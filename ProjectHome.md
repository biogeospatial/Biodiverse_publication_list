# Overview #

Biodiverse is a tool for the spatial analysis of diversity using indices based on taxonomic, phylogenetic and matrix-based (e.g. genetic distance) relationships, as well as related environmental and temporal variations. Biodiverse supports the following processes:

  1. Linked visualisation of data distributions in geographic, taxonomic, phylogenetic and matrix spaces;
  1. Spatial moving window analyses including richness, endemism, phylogenetic diversity and beta diversity;
  1. Spatially constrained agglomerative cluster analyses;
  1. Spatially constrained region grower analyses;
  1. Interactive visualisation of turnover patterns (for example beta-diversity); and
  1. Randomisations for hypothesis testing.

Biodiverse is open-source and supports user developed extensions. It can be used both through a graphical user interface (GUI) and through user written scripts.

More than 250 indices are supported.  See the [Indices](Indices.md) page.
