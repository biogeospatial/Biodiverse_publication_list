# Introduction #

This is an overview of the help system.  At this stage the system is very much a work in progress.  Any constructive feedback is appreciated, either through comments on the pages themselves, or by raising a new issue (https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/issues/).

Use the side bar at the right to navigate between most pages.

At this stage the main reference is the [SampleSession](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/wiki/SampleSession) file.  It can get pretty heavy in parts, and there are plans to separate the content into their own pages, leaving an easier to read overview.

For a lighter introduction, see the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/wiki/Downloads#quick-start-guide).
