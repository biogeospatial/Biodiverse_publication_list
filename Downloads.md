There is also a series of blog posts at http://biodiverse-analysis-software.blogspot.com.au/

### Quick Start Guide ###

A [quick start guide](http://biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/downloads/Biodiverse_Quick_Start_Guide_0.19.pdf) for version 0.19 is also available.

#### Known issues ####

  * There appear to be problems with the cp936 locale, and probably other CJK character set locales.  The workaround for now is to set your locale and region to US (see details in [Issue 506](/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/issues/506)).
