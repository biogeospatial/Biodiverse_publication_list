## Biodiverse GUI ##


There is also a series of blog posts at http://biodiverse-analysis-software.blogspot.com.au/

### Quick Start Guide ###

A [quick start guide](http://biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/downloads/Biodiverse_Quick_Start_Guide_2018-09-05.pdf) is available.


### Stable Release ###

_The current stable release is version 2.1, released 23-Aug-2018._

The [release notes](http://purl.org/biodiverse/wiki/ReleaseNotes#version-21) summarise the changes in this version.

[Installation instructions](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/wiki/Installation).

All versions are for 64 bit architectures.

*NOTE:  These were updated 07-Dec-2018 to fix issue #711.  This was an issue exporting to shapefiles, but which otherwise has no effect.*

#### Known issues ####

  * There appear to be problems with the cp936 locale, and probably other CJK character set locales.  The workaround for now is to set your locale and region to US (see details in [Issue 506](/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/issues/506)).
