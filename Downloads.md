## Biodiverse GUI ##


There is also a series of blog posts at http://biodiverse-analysis-software.blogspot.com.au/

### Quick Start Guide ###

A [quick start guide](http://biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/downloads/Biodiverse_Quick_Start_Guide_0.19.pdf) is available.  This is written for version 0.19, but still applies to the current version.


### Stable Release ###

_The current stable release is version 1.1._

*NOTE:  New windows files released on 09-May-2016 to fix an issue with incomplete encoding files being packed.  This meant that some trees were not correctly imported.  Please download this if you are using an older version.  This replaces the update released in February 2016.*

The [release notes](http://purl.org/biodiverse/wiki/ReleaseNotes#version-11) summarise the changes in this version.

#### Known issues ####

  * There appear to be problems with the cp936 locale, and probably other CJK character set locales.  The workaround for now is to set your locale and region to US (see details in [Issue 506](/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/issues/506)).
