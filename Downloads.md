## Biodiverse GUI ##


There is also a series of blog posts at http://biodiverse-analysis-software.blogspot.com.au/

### Quick Start Guide ###

A [quick start guide](http://biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/downloads/Biodiverse_Quick_Start_Guide_2018-09-05.pdf) is available.


### Stable Release ###

_The current stable release is version 4.1, released 07-Feb-2023._

The [release notes](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/wiki/ReleaseNotes#version-41) summarise the changes in this version.

All versions are for 64 bit architectures.

* Windows, Mac and Ubuntu binaries as well as source code [are available through GitHub](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/releases/tag/r4.1)

* [Installation instructions](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/wiki/Installation)


#### Known issues ####

  * If you have issues accessing files in your Documents folder then you will need to give access to the app.  See https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/mac-help/mchld5a35146/mac 
  * There may be problems with the cp936 locale, and probably other CJK character set locales.  The workaround for now is to set your locale and region to US (see details in [Issue 506](/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/issues/506)).
