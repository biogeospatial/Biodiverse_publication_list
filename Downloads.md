## Biodiverse GUI ##


There is also a series of blog posts at http://biodiverse-analysis-software.blogspot.com.au/

### Quick Start Guide ###

A [quick start guide](http://biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/downloads/Biodiverse_Quick_Start_Guide_0.19.pdf) is available.  This is written for version 0.19, but still applies to the current version.


### Stable Release ###

_The current stable release is version 2.0, released 14-Nov-2016._

The [release notes](http://purl.org/biodiverse/wiki/ReleaseNotes#version-20) summarise the changes in this version.

All versions are for 64 bit architectures.

* [Windows (~38MB)](http://biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/downloads/biodiverse_2.0_win.zip)

* [MacOS (~28MB)](http://biodiverse.unsw.edu.au/downloads/biodiverse_2.0_mac.zip)


#### Known issues ####

  * There appear to be problems with the cp936 locale, and probably other CJK character set locales.  The workaround for now is to set your locale and region to US (see details in [Issue 506](/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/issues/506)).
